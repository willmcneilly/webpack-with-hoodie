# Hoodie, React and Webpack example

A quick test app to figure out how to get a Hoodie working with a webpack compiled React app.

Hoodie server runs as separate process from the webpack dev server so we can have nice things like hot module replacement.

  $ npm install
  $ npm run dev-server
  $ hoodie start
